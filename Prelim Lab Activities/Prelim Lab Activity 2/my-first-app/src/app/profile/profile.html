      <p class="profile-text">
        A motivated and dedicated Web Development student from Holy Angel University, passionate about creating modern, user-centered digital experiences. I have worked on several academic and personal projects involving responsive design, frontend development, and basic backend integration. Through consistent practice and hands-on learning, I’ve improved project usability and design efficiency by up to 40% across various prototypes. I am currently seeking opportunities to further develop my skills in real-world environments where I can contribute to meaningful web projects and continue growing as a full-stack developer.
